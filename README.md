# Multilingual-braille-recognition

The multilingual Braille system using deep learning is an innovative project that aims to develop a technological aid that will let people with visual impairments access information in several languages. The objective of the proposed system is to address this communication asymmetry and facilitate information exchange between blind and non-blind individuals, promoting inclusivity and balanced communication.
The technology converts Braille characters into the appropriate text representations using deep learning algorithms, allowing users to comprehend and interact with text information.
Our website provides the users with the choice of three languages English, hindi and malayalam. The user can select and upload a braille image and it will be converted to the respective character.

We have hosted and deployed the web application using flask on localhost.

1- Clone the repository.

2- Install python , anaconda (jupyter notebook) and spyder

3- Navigate to the directory where this repository is downloaded.

4- Open the jupyter notebook files for each language , pip install the necesaary modules and then run and save the model in the same directory.

5- Open the flaskdeploy.py file in spyder and run it.

6- the web application will be now available in your localhost with default port as 8000.
